                Inkwell aims to:
            </p>
            <ul class="fs-5">
                <li>💡 Share quality content on programming, development, and digital life</li>

            <h4 class="mt-5 text-info fw-bold">🛠️ Built With Love & Code</h4>
            <p class="fs-5">
                Inkwell is handcrafted using <strong>Flask (Python)</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, and a mix of modern web tools.
                It's not powered by any big CMS — every feature you see is designed, built, and styled from scratch. 
                That makes this platform not just personal — but meaningful.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-5 text-info fw-bold">🌐 What’s Next?</h4>
            <p class="fs-5">
                As Inkwell evolves, you can expect more features — from AI-powered insights to community interactions. 
                Whether you're a casual reader or a fellow creator, I hope you find something here that sticks with you.
